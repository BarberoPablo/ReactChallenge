## This project is a React Challenge, the expected features were:

- Should be able to remove items from Cart.
- Should be able to edit quantity of items.
- Should be able to display updated total price based on items in cart.

## Extras:

- Home page with products to add to cart.
- When adding a product to the car, this shows a red dot with the amount of "diferent items"
- Usage of React hooks to handle state management and efficiency.
- Cart button to go to "Your cart"
- In "Components/assets/products-JSON.ts" there is a list of interfaces that I used and there is a array "products" with all the available products to "add to cart".
- When modifying the Quantity, you can select as many items as the stock of that product allows you to (this is visible in "products" from "products-JSON.ts").
- "Order summary" and "Cart" button shows the amount of different items in the cart, not the overall quantity.
